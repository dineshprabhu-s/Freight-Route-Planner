The Freight Route Planner is a Java-based project designed to optimize freight transportation logistics for a train network. This project aims to provide an efficient and cost-effective solution for planning the path of a freight train engine while taking into account the effect of loading and unloading containers.

A demonstration of the project's functionality is presented [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s2_7J0enRA)
